## Prerequisites

* schemas/organization to understand basic split

## Overview

Most server are can keep all type definitions and resolvers in a single file, which enables atomic schema modification. Sometimes a schema grows to require  multiple files. The following examples show how to separate a schema into multiple files to maintain developer experience.

For schemas with simple dependencies, type definitions are combined in an array and resolvers are merged together. In more complicated situations with circular dependencies, type definitions can be returned as functions. This allows Apollo Server to store a single copy of duplicate type definitions to conserve memory and maintain performance. Throughout all the examples, the resolvers delegate to a data model, as explained in [this section]().

> Note: This schema separation should be done by product or real-world domain, which create natural boundaries that are easier to reason about.

<h2 id="organizing-types">Organizing schema types</h2>

With large schema, defining types in different files and merge them to create the complete schema may become necessary. We accomplish this by importing and exporting schema strings, combining them into arrays as necessary. The following example demonstrates separating the type definitions of [this schema](#first-example-schema) found at the end of the page.

```js
// comment.js
const typeDefs = gql`
  type Comment {
    id: ID!
    message: String
    author: String
  }
`;

export typeDefs;
```

The `Post` includes a reference to `Comment`, which is added to the array of type definitions and exported:

```js
// post.js
const Comment = require('./comment');

// concat allows the comment typeDefs to be a string or an array
const typeDefs = [`
  type Post {
    id: ID!
    title: String
    content: String
    author: String
    comments: [Comment]
  }
`].concat(Comment.typeDefs);

// Export Post and all dependent types
export typeDefs;
```

Finally the root Query type, which uses Post, is created and passed to the server instantiation:

```js
// schema.js
const Post = require('./post');

const RootQuery = `
  type Query {
    post(id: ID!): Post
  }
`;

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs: [RootQuery].concat(Post.typeDefs),
  resolvers, //defined in next section
});

server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at ${url}`)
});
```

<h2 id="organizing-resolvers">Organizing resolvers</h2>

For the type definitions above, we can accomplish the same modularity with resolvers by combining each type's resolvers together with Lodash's `merge` or another equivalent. The [end of this page](#first-example-resolvers) contains a complete view of the resolver map.

```js
// comment.js
const CommentModel = require('./models/comment');

const resolvers = {
  Comment: {
    votes: (parent) => CommentModel.getVotesById(parent.id)
  }
};

export resolvers;
```

The post type contains a reference to `Comment`, so we must include the `Comment` resolvers:

```js
// post.js
const { merge } = require('lodash');
const Comment = require('./comment');
const PostModel = require('./models/post');

const resolvers = merge({
  Post: {
    comments: (parent) => PostModel.getCommentsById(parent.id)
  }
}, Comment.resolvers);

export resolvers;
```

Finally, the Query type's resolvers are merged and the result is passed to the server instantiation:

```js
// schema.js
const { merge } = require('lodash');
const Post = require('./post');

const PostModel = require('./models/post');

// Merge all of the resolver objects together
const resolvers = merge({
  Query: {
    post: (_, args) => PostModel.getPostById(args.id)
  }
}, Post.resolvers);

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs, //defined in previous section
  resolvers,
});

server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at ${url}`)
});
```

<h2 id="sharing-modular-types">Sharing circular types across domains</h2>

Schemas often contain circular dependencies or a shared type that is referenced in separate files. When exporting type definitions, the result should be wrapped in a function. Apollo Server will only include each type definition once, even if it is imported multiple times by different types. Preventing duplication of type definitions means that domains can be self contained and fully functional regardless of how they are combined. Conversely, resolvers are safely combined with a `merge`, since they are namespaced by the schema types.

The next example uses [a schema](#example-circular) with a circular reference between `Author` and `Book`. The first file contains all information to support the `Author` type, which depends on `Book`.

```js
// author.js
const { merge } = require('lodash');
const Book = require('./book');

const Author = `
  type Author {
    id: ID!
    name: String
    books: [Book]
  }
`;

// export Author and all dependent types wrapped
// in a function to avoid string duplication
export const typeDefs = () => [Author].concat(Book.typeDefs);

export const resolvers = merge({
  Author: { ... }
}, Book.resolvers);
```

In turn, this file wholly contains `Book` and its dependency on `Author`.

```js
// book.js
const { merge } = require('lodash');
const Author = require('./author');

const Book = `
  type Book {
    title: String
    author: Author
  }
`;

export const typeDefs = () => [Book].concat(Author.typeDefs);

export const resolvers = merge({
  Book: { ... }
}, Author.resolvers);
```

Finally, the `Author` type definitions and resolvers are combine with the root `Query`.

```js
// schema.js
const { merge } = require('lodash');
const Author = require('./author');

const resolvers = merge({
  Query: { ... }
}, Author.resolvers);

const RootQuery = `
  type Query {
    author(id: ID!): Author
  }
`;

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs: [RootQuery].concat(Author.typeDefs),
  resolvers,
});

server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at ${url}`)
});
```

> Note: Type definitions wrapped in functions can be combined with raw type definition strings.

<h2 id="extend-types">Extending types</h2>

The `extend` keyword provides the ability to add fields to existing types. Using `extend` is particularly useful in avoiding a large list of fields on root Queries and Mutations.

```js
const barTypeDefs = `
"Query can and must be defined once per schema to be extended"
type Query {
  bars: [Bar]
}

type Bar {
  id: String
}
`;

// These type definitions are often in a separate file
const fooTypeDefs = `
type Foo {
  id: String
}

extend type Query {
  foos: [Foo]
}
`

export const typeDefs = [barTypeDefs, fooTypeDefs]
```
